World Of Warcraft: Cache Cleaner - Gimme Back My Bytes - Nom Nom Nom, Nom Nom Nom


This is a very very simple application, to help users with space limitations, or those running on SSDs that want to keep the 18GB free space rule.
What it does is removes The Cache and Data\Cache directories recursively.
This only clears databases, and loaded files from visited instances etc..
None of your Settings will be lost

The path is saved to the registry for the next time you open it.
Nothing more - Nothing less...

Ask for features - i.e. addon backups etc, and I'll implement them - or take the code and do it yourself. Just a little starting point really :D
